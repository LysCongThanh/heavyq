# Spare machines

Add a remote in `~/.config/heavyq/config.toml`:

```toml
[[remote]]
name = "buildbox"     # used in --remote buildbox and in status
ssh = "buildbox"      # an alias from ~/.ssh/config (key auth; ControlMaster recommended)
heavy_slots = 2
light_slots = 2
cache_hook = '''
# optional: restore node_modules from a cache keyed by the lockfile
[ -f package-lock.json ] || exit 0
key=$(sha256sum package-lock.json | cut -c1-16); c="$HEAVYQ_CACHE_DIR/nm-$key"
if [ -d "$c" ]; then cp -al "$c" node_modules; exit; fi
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund && { cp -al node_modules "$c.$$" && mv -T "$c.$$" "$c" || rm -rf "$c.$$"; } 2>/dev/null; true
'''
```

Then:

```bash
heavyq 3 --remote buildbox -- npm test        # always there
heavyq 3 --remote auto -- npm test            # best score; you vouch the command is self-contained
heavyq 3 -- npm test                          # best score only if the repo is clean and paths stay inside it
heavyq 3 --remote local -- npm test           # never leave this machine
heavyq 3 --needs-ram -- npm run e2e           # place by free RAM only
heavyq 3 --remote buildbox --base-ref origin/main -- npm run lint:changed   # recreate origin/main there
heavyq 3 --remote buildbox --with ../shared-lib@v2.1.0 -- npm test          # sibling repo pinned to a commit
```

What a remote run sees, and what it doesn't:

- **Only committed code.** The exact SHA of `--ref` is pushed with `git push` (it doesn't need to be on
  GitHub). Uncommitted edits and ignored files (`.env.test`, `dist/`) stay behind.
- **Environment variables don't travel.** `FOO=1 heavyq ... -- npm test` sets `FOO` only locally. Put them
  inside the command: `heavyq 3 -- env FOO=1 npm test`.
- **The same subdirectory.** If you run from `repo/packages/web`, the command runs in `packages/web` of the
  remote worktree.
- **Clean teardown.** The remote side holds a lifeline on stdin. If heavyq dies, even by SIGKILL, or the
  connection drops, the remote stops the command's process group and removes the worktree. Exit 255 means
  the connection was lost.

Remote requirements: Linux with `bash`, `git`, `flock`, `setsid` (util-linux), `base64`, `awk`. Nothing is
installed. Everything lives under `work_dir` (default `~/.heavyq`).
